Project Title: A Travel Guide Website

Language used: HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, PHP

Description:
A travel blog is a personal experience sharing website. There are total 5
sections in the navbar(Home, About, Blog, Destination, Contact Us) .
Homepage is covered in index.html page. In homepage, we are first greeted
with a carousel containing 3 pictures. Then some of the destinations have
been introduced with cards. And later we have the image gallery following
the footer. About page is for introducing the admin of the page and his/her
visions about the website. Blog page contains the list of all the blogs in the
website. We can get access to all the blogs from here. All the blogs are
written in the specified destination blog pages like blog_cox.html,
blog_sundarban.html etc. The destination section in the navbar is created
using a dropdown menu with all the destinations. In a destination page, all the
important and popular tourist spots are featured, image gallery for that
destinations are also added along with the blog post. Through contact us page
users can contact the admin of the website for any inquiry. It is
connected to the ‘website’ database using PHP where all the messages can be
seen. Image galleries are created using pages like img_coxBazar,
img_bandarban etc and for all these pages a single img_page.css is used for
styling. And style.css is used to style the index.html page. Finally, the
exported database ‘website’ is also added to the project.
